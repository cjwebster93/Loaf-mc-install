# LOAF Custom MC Install script

Script to assist in installing the correct components to join the modded LOAF Minecraft server.

**REQUIREMENTS**
- Make sure you have [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed, particularly for the Forge client install.

**TODO**
- [x] Download and install base Minecraft game
- [x] Download and install *specific* Forge addon
- [ ] Install required modpacks

It *does* require user interaction where the 3rd-party files don't appear to have any silent functions.
